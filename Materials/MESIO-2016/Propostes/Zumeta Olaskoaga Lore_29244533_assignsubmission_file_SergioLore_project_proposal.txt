Project assessment proposal
Sergio Moreno and Lore Zumeta

1.Goal:
	Scrap some tables from the giro d'italia web page and try to answer the below questions. 

-Which is the runners ranking (the top 20) of the last 3 Behobias (2014,2015,2016)
-Which is the female proportion in each race (2014, 2015, 2016)?
-How are the runners grouped according to their category? or the nationalities?

2.The data source and web technology it is based upon:

	We will use the official web page of the race: https://www.behobia-sansebastian.com/index.php
	The classfications are exactly in this url: http://clasificacion.behobia-sansebastian.com/oficial.php?accion=buscar&paginacion=&siguiente=&tipo=&lang=&ano=2016&categoria=&nombre=&apellido=&localidad=&dorsal=&buscar=Buscar#ancla

It is written in html.

3.The approach/technology that you will use for downloading:

	We will use the R package rvest and the html file will be parsed by means of read_html() function.

4.How you plan to clean the data (scraping):

We will try to clean the data constructing tables (or data frames), for that purpose regular expressions will be useful. We will need to create a function due to classifications of different years are in different addresses. A function we will compute the data cleanising in a more automatic way.

5.How you would analyze the extracted information:
We will analyze by doing some descriptive analysis and plotting some graphics.
