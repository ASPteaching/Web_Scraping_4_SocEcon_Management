Abstract of the project:

Sport is a catalan daily sports newspaper founded in 1979. It writes mainly about Football Club Barcelona and Spanish football.

This newspaper has an electronic version in http://www.sport.es/es/, with html source code. Although the news are presented in an organized way, we think as
lifelong Barça supporters and usual readers of Sport that it is difficult to know quickly what news are about what you are interested on.

Because of this, our goal is to create an app that provides the URL of the news that are interesting for you. In a cell, you will write any 
character string related to your interest. The app will look for the news that contain in their heading (title or subtitles) this character string. 

The programming procedure will be based on web scrapping in R. In addition, we will study Shiny (which seems very interesting) in order to present the results in such a 
way that a user will be able to interact with the program in a web structure without knowing anything about R.
